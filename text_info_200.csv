 2023/04/30 23:16
 
〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國西洋棋好手丁立人今（30）日在2023西洋棋世界冠軍賽決賽中擊敗世界排名第2的俄羅斯棋手涅波姆尼亞奇（Ian Nepomniachtchi），成為新科西洋棋世界冠軍。
《法新社》報導，在今日的比賽中，丁立人與涅波姆尼亞奇可以說是棋逢對手，前14局中各自贏下3局，餘下8局則為和局，比賽因此進入到快棋加賽決勝階段，而這階段每一步只有10秒的思考時間。
請繼續往下閱讀...
 
然而兩邊在快棋賽局中也是殺得難分難解，前3盤也是持續打平，一直到第4盤丁立人才棋高一著勝出，從挪威的卡爾森（Magnus Carlsen）手中接下棋王寶座。
根據世界西洋棋總會（FIDE）排名，1992年出生，現年30歲的丁立人在世界排名榜名列第3，他前面分別是本次決賽對手涅波姆尼亞奇，以及自2013年起連續稱霸5屆，但本次大賽放棄尋求衛冕的卡爾森。
