0,@PHChess @FIDE_chess This is shameful @FIDE_chess
0,@PHChess @FIDE_chess Peter thank you !!!!
0,@PHChess @FIDE_chess Have you ever considered that you are the problem?
0,"@PHChess @FIDE_chess Now this is nitpicking. My guess is the players agreed to it, perhaps even one of them asked for it, and the other agreed. :) I do agree to most of your tweets, but this one is a non-issue to try to catch FIDE on imho."

1,"@FurqanS54323862 @PHChess @EmilSutovsky @FIDE_chess Just because you're Russian doesn't mean you have to support your government.  With information so easily accessible ignorance is not a defense, Russia is committing genocide and anyone openly supporting them should be banned from participating in FIDE events."
1,"@FurqanS54323862 @PHChess @EmilSutovsky @FIDE_chess On the contrary, Peter is with you. There are Russian players (and Karjakin is the worst) and a chess organisation who make the game political. Peter opposes to it and you and I might expect that your and my FIDE is with us."
1,@PHChess @FIDE_chess @DanaReiznieceOz @EmilSutovsky @davidllada @advorkovich Breaking: Russian chess players decide to play chess in Russia.
1,"@Inamull41432528 @THAR_04 @PHChess @FIDE_chess @DanaReiznieceOz @EmilSutovsky @davidllada @advorkovich Because Hikaru did not support any of these wars, what a stupid question, I have nothing against the Russians in chess, Nepomniaschie, for example, along with other famous Russian chess players, wrote an open letter to Putin after February 24, 2022, urging him not to start a war."
1,"@PHChess @FIDE_chess Even if he was in the military and was in the war , you can call him even a war criminal if you want .. in their eyes they are patriotic and defending their country interests , you cannot mix chess or games/sports with other things , or you should ban isreal/usa and many more."
1,@THAR_04 @PHChess @FIDE_chess @DanaReiznieceOz @EmilSutovsky @davidllada @advorkovich If the country in question was a Terrorist State then yes it is.
1,"@PHChess @EmilSutovsky @FIDE_chess Peter, just leave him alone.He is a russian and if we were russians, we would probably look at the world from a different lense too. Dont make it about good and evil, and make the game political. It should be about chess and only about chess."
1,"@PHChess @FIDE_chess I checked your tweets and Jesus Christ, more than 75% of them are about the war and you are not from Ukraine. You might have some serious problems. As for Ian, he's obviously Russian, even though he's not representing Russia as a country in this tournament. Seek help."
1,@PHChess @FIDE_chess He is Russian. Deal with it.

6,"@ABD08922063 @FIDE_chess No!!!! Carlsen is currently the best player in the world, one of the best players in history. He's probably better than Ding. But the 17th world champion is Ding Liren. Nobody was stopping Magnus from defending his title. üôÇ"
6,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess I was against Magnus Carlsen's decision to refuse to play WCCM. But now I have to thank Magnus for giving me the opportunity to watch such an exciting world championship match.
6,"I have to say I wasn't expecting much from the #NepoDing match. Because... Magnus is just one. But... That match is great and maybe much, much more interesting than if Magnus had played it."
7,"If there is one dominant theme in #NepoDing for me, it is that Ding has been battling Ding, and Nepo is still wrestling with Nepo."
7,"@Shubham11752263 @FIDE_chess Chess is more than playing good moves, Nepo played many great moves but Ding was the more balanced person during the match.

In the end Ding made with Rg6 the last great move, Nepo couldn‚Äôt handle the shift from a draw because of repetition to having to fight for a draw."

7,"#DingLiren is contemplating his 47th move. Both Nepo and Ding have a rook and knight each on the board. Nepo has 3 pawns to Ding's 2. They still are sweating it out.

7,"Tenth game, draw. I'm good at Ding in English. There was just a little bit of a feeling that if they won, it would be white, but Nepo's defense was clever, and nothing in particular happened and the game came to an end. There are four games left. Nepo is in the lead with a match score of 5.5-4.5. Can Ding be taken back?

#NepoDing https://t.co/NSSvAIb79E"
7,"The eleventh game, draw. It ended early, wasn't it? Nepo is satisfied with the draw, and Ding is also black and has decided that it's not time to set up a risky game. There are 2 more games left for Ding to play white. The match score is now 6-5.

#NepoDing https://t.co/7vxRwv7M2c"
7,"Game 14 of the World Chess Championship.

This COULD be the final game!

If Nepo wants any chances to win, he must hold a draw here.

But as a Ding Fan, let Ding be Ding Chilling!

Like I said before, Nepo not even needs the money.
There can be no two opinions on how someone in Nepos place should act!"
23,"@Shubham11752263 @FIDE_chess I root for Nepo, but you forgot the part where he won the last candidate game against Nakamura for 2nd place. He equalized three times, especially in the last game from a losing position. His opening preparation was leaked. and the part where he managed to lead in the final game"
23,@PHChess @okayishchess @FIDE_chess He could be competing as a neutral athlete. But Nepo will always be Russian. Nothing wrong with the statement.
23,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess Now nepo will take over
23,"@AkbarDurrani0 @FIDE_chess classical &amp; rapid portions but even for both the classical &amp; rapid portions individually. Nepo lost only 3x to Wesley So while Magnus lost 4x.

- Magnus &amp; Nepo played the same opponents - Wesley So &amp; Fabi. Both beat Fabi. Both lost to Wesley So. Nepo was just unfortunate to face"
23,"@Nathe_Renad @PHChess @okayishchess @FIDE_chess Yeah, it's weird to argue against this singular statement. If Nepo was ""nationless"", one could argue Russian GM is faulty (in that case ""Russian-born"" would make more sense). As a matter of fact, Nepo is still a Russian citizen and Russian by birth. Hence, Russian GM is correct."

23,"@PHChess @teenitr @FIDE_chess These people are trolling you. Even if you want to be transparent and fair, you shouldn't discuss with them.
About Nepo, I like him more than Magnus, but Nepo has enough money through his chess.

26,@AkbarDurrani0 @FIDE_chess He seems to lose at the very last moment. That must be devastating. But is not to say he's not as good as them. He dominated the Candidates. 2 time WC challenger I'm sure he'll bounce back

26,"@romain_edouard @SchachNotizen @FIDE_chess well, you'll notice i didn't offer an opinion as to whether they should do so.

that's because i'm not sure. i mean, i don't consider them to be a WC in the same way i consider Anand to be a WC. 

but i do agree it's odd for FIDE to just pretend they didn't crown them champ."
26,"@zneroleahcim @FIDE_chess Isn't that kinda what he tried for the previous match, against MC? And it fell through because it didn't suit his style. He needs to be true to his style&amp;inspiration to perform at his best.
But if that comes with the cost of him playing too fast&amp;losing by it, he'll never be WC."
26,"@SchachNotizen @romain_edouard @FIDE_chess i mean, with the few exceptions where the world champion refused or was unavailable, the requirement to become world champion was always to beat the reigning world champion.

i have a ton of respect for the FIDE champs but there was always going to be tension regarding this."
26,@Onkar729 @FIDE_chess Ashamed?‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs literally the biggest title in chess so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs nothing but proud of himself. It‚Äôs not that uncommon as you might think for a World Champion not be perceived as the world‚Äôs best
26,"@EmilSutovsky @FIDE_chess It is not applicable for this match, because there is no challenger and champion, but why not change the rules for the next one, so that the challenger must defeat the champion, who retains his title if the match ends without a winner?

30,"22...Bxe4? 23.Qxe4 and it seems Ian Nepomniachtchi is losing! A 5th win for White in a row?

30,"Giri's theory for why Nepomniachtchi is thinking here (when 15...dxe5! is the only computer-approved move) is that Ian's preparation included 12...cxd4, when this e5-move wouldn't be an issue

30,"Nepomniachtchi's 5...Qc7 was a very rare move, but also the computer's top choice: https://t.co/9UJT5KtOWh

30,"15...Qb6!? was the natural move (the computer wanted 15...Qd8!) but after 16.Ne5! Nepomniachtchi already has the huge threat of Nd7 ‚Äî could we get a 4th win for White in a row today?

30,"19.Bc2!? is flagged as a mistake by the computer ‚Äî a real chance for Ian Nepomniachtchi to all but close out the match today?

30,"21.Rg1!? is perhaps an inaccuracy, but the commentators were also looking at it and pointing out there are plenty of ways for Nepomniachtchi to go wrong! 21...f4! is the only clearly better move for Black

31,"@Ch_Beaucaire @FIDE_chess China would hold both the men and women‚Äôs titles too, since the upcoming Women‚Äôs Championship is between two Chinese players"
31,"@SSanesti @Maxwell12402371 @FIDE_chess The chess world was very welcoming to Judit Polgar. She's far more famous than men of similar playing strength.
And the chess world has become even more welcoming to women since that time."
31,"@GroBerunFug1 @NST_Online @FIDE_chess Nobody is missing the word ""male""
No woman has ever been the open world champion. Commonly called World Champion.
Women's World Champion is a separate category."
31,"@TheSiasatDaily @FIDE_chess It's not the men's World Champion, it's the World Champion.

Women are not excluded from competing with men in chess like in tennis or golf."
31,"@ZinanMelo @QueerThassie @FIDE_chess It's not ""male chess"" it's just chess. Judit Polgar made a candidate's cup, and reaching that level is something so few achieve. When there's far less women in chess compared to men the vast majority of the top will be men. Ding and Nepo's chess skill doesnt belong to all men."
31,"@BobJonessssss @Maxwell12402371 @FIDE_chess You're talking about what women do *right now*, you're not thinking about what they could do if the chess world was actually welcoming for women."
31,"@GroBerunFug1 @mathrubhumieng @FIDE_chess No such thing as a Men's World Champion.
There's World Champion and Women's World Champion.
No woman, Chinese or otherwise, has ever been World Champion."
31,"@SSanesti @Maxwell12402371 @FIDE_chess Sry, but Hou Yifan literally said that she observed that most women don't work as hard on chess as men and she says it's because they are going more for a balanced &amp; more social life.
Why do you think you know better what women want?"
31,"@GroBerunFug1 @msianinsight @FIDE_chess No woman, Chinese or otherwise, has ever won the World Championship.
They have won the Women's World Championship, but never the open category commonly referred to as World Champion.
There is no such thing as a Men's World Championship."
31,"@GroBerunFug1 @BangkokPostNews @FIDE_chess Not really.
No women has ever been World Champion.
There are two titles.  World Champion, and Women's World Champion.
Women may compete for both titles, but as of yet, none have won the open category that is referred to as World Champion."
32,@JosefineHeinem4 @FIDE_chess @GothamChess @ben_finegold @souleidis @agadmator @TheButcherChess @IM_Rosen @Bodenseeperlen @CmielThorsten It's a pity to see how Ding blundered away a good position during his extreme time trouble today. That's kind of an illogical end to a very interesting and tense game.
32,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess Would you think it will be another brain fading moment for Ding?
32,@olimpiuurcan @FIDE_chess I don't think Levon was wrong. Ian lost the game much more than Ding won
32,@PHChess @FIDE_chess @olimpiuurcan Ding is a nice guy but his country is same shit as Ian`s . and their championship would be unfortunately for their country.
32,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess My money is on Ding from here!
32,DING! @FIDE_chess @chesscom ...
32,"@kytmagic @ChessVonDoom @FIDE_chess Same. I think it would/will be extremely good for chess worldwide if/when Ding wins. I also find him extremely likeable.

I'll feel bad for whoever loses, though. Playing this many tough games and coming so close is gonna be brutal for whoever doesn't win."
32,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess Another blunder by ding nepo!! Ding should have taken rook from his queen
32,"@GoofySommelier @jmalquezar @FIDE_chess Yeah, everyone knows this.

But I think it is a matter of course to give Ian and Ding who played and gave their best in the last weeks a big respect today.

It is just a question of personal class.

But I understand that not everyone has it."
32,@vishy64theking @FIDE_chess Ding did it
